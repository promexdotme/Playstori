# 🟢 THE PLAY STORI MANIFESTO: Refactoring the Digital Nursery

## 1. The Incident Report
Modern "Edutainment" is a system failure. Most kids' apps are essentially data-exfiltration scripts wrapped in slot-machine logic. They are bloated with "Internet Trash"—unskippable ads, dopamine-triggering rewards, and tracking pixels. 

As developers, we know that **bad code crashes servers, but bad logic crashes countries.** We are hitting the Hard Reset.

## 2. Our Mission
**Play Stori** is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit (NGO) dedicated to building a "Digital Sanctuary" for children. The name defines the architecture:
* **PLAY:** A library of 500+ clean, ad-free, tracking-free HTML5 games.
* **STORI:** An animation pipeline retelling the "Root Wisdom" of humanity (e.g., *Kalila wa Dimna*, *Aesop*, *1001 Nights*) into interactive cartoons.

## 3. The Tech Stack Protocol
We prioritize **Digital Sovereignty** and **Privacy by Design**:
* **Zero-Data Kernel:** No databases for user data. No cookies. No tracking.
* **Lightweight Delivery:** Built with a high-performance HTML5 core, ready for web and mobile (via Capacitor).
* **Open Source:** Transparency is our only firewall. We don't want your data; we want your audit.

## 4. How to Contribute
We need your **Brain** more than your **Cash**:
* **Quality Assurance:** Test the draft at [PlayStori.org](https://www.playstori.org/) and open an Issue for any UX "friction."
* **Logic & Stories:** Suggest fables or moral tales that need a "digital refactor" into an animated story.
* **Code:** Help us optimize game performance and asset loading for low-bandwidth environments.
