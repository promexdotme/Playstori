			<h2>Installation</h2>
			<p>
				Actually there is no installation proccess for HTML5 content, you can just double-click .html file to open it.<br>
				But there are a restriction for local HTML file, browser can't load local files, so this restriction causing all game assets like images and sounds can't be loaded and shown.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can fix it by opening the game (html) with localserver.<br>
				Local server apps: Laragon, NodeJS, USBWebserver (Light weight) and there are many other similar software.
			</p>
			<p>If you upload the game files on live webserver (Your website), it should run fine without any technical issues.</p>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Item Structure</h2>
			<p>As you see, there is 2 main folder inside item file, "cloudarcade" and "html5" folder.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>cloudarcade</strong> folder mean, the game inside this folder is suitable for CloudArcade CMS or this game version is already integrated with CloudArcade API.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>html5</strong> folder mean, is a clean version of the game or the main game files, this version is not contain any external API and can be used as your base project.
			</p>
			<p>
				Both these 2 folder have 2 folder inside, "minified" and "source", what it's mean ? <b>"minified"</b> mean, all the scripts inside this folder is minified or obsfucated, simply the script is protected and very hard to read, so anyone who play your game and inspect it can't copy or stole the game code or make it harder for anyone who trying to hack or crack the game.<br>
				This "minified" version is strongly recommended to be published online (public).
			</p>
			<p><b>"source"</b> or also called the source code, the game scripts on this version is readable and this version is used for base project, example if you want to edit game scripts or modify the game.</p>
